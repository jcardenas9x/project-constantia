## What is Last Origin?

Last Origin is a Korean smartphone game developed by SmartJoy, officially released in March, 2019. While it is published initially on the Google Play and Apple App Stores, these clients are censored.

The developers released an uncensored version on the Korean "OneStore," a home-grown marketfront created and maintained by Korean mobile carriers.

The game is set in a futuristic time where humanity has been destroyed by alien invaders known as "Ironworms." You play as the last surviving human and have to work together with artificially created lifeforms named "Bioroids" to fight back the alien threat and find a way to restore humanity.

### TL;DR?

Knock up some android girls and kick some alien ass.

## How to Play?

Last Origin features turn-based combat on two opposing 3x3 grids. Use squads of up to 5 Bioroids to fight the aliens. 

The game also has a non-traditional resource system, similar to games like _Girl's Frontline_ and _Azur Lane_. There are three resources available to you, which regenerate naturally over time, X amount every 10 minutes:

1. Gears 
2. Nutrients (look like green pills)
3. Batteries (look like blue boxes)

Each Bioroid you use costs a sum of these resources to deploy in battle. Upgrading your equipment, producing new Bioroids and/or equipment, as well as researching new technology all cost a sum of these resources.

So it is very important that you manage these right. It's also because you can use these resources to get new units that **you do not need to reroll**.
